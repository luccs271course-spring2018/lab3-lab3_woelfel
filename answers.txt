1) TODO also try with a LinkedList - does it make any difference?

The linked list won't make a difference in how the program will run.

2) list.remove(5); // what does this method do?

Removes the value occupying the 5th spot in the list. The 6th value in the overall size would become the 5th value.

3) TODO what happens if you use list.remove(77)?

Would cause an error because there isn't a 77 position in the list. 

4) which of the two lists performs better as the size increases?

An Array List is more efficient for larger collections than Linked List.

5) list.remove(Integer.valueOf(5)); // what does this one do?

It removes the Int 5 from the list.
